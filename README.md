# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System
A beginner-friendly Content-Based Movie Recommendation System built using Python and Machine Learning.
This project recommends movies based on similarity of movie descriptions using Natural Language Processing techniques.
---
## 🚀 Features
- Recommends top 5 similar movies
- Case-insensitive movie search
- Input validation (handles missing movies)
- Fast execution using optimized dataset
- Beginner-friendly implementation
---
## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
---
## 📌 How It Works
1. Loads movie dataset
2. Cleans and preprocesses text data
3. Converts movie descriptions into vectors using CountVectorizer
4. Calculates cosine similarity between movies
5. Recommends movies based on similarity score

## ▶ How to Run
Install dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
Run the program:
python main.py
Enter any movie name when prompted.
